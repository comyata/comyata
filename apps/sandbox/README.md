# Comyata Runtime in React

Example setup of [@comyata/run](https://github.com/comyata/comyata) with react hooks, Codemirror input and MUI.

The template input supports YAML or JSON templates, the output in this example produces JSON.

Use [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/) to include logic inside the template.

## Simplify Data Processing and Beyond

Comyata Runtime is more than just a templating engine. Itâ€™s a powerful tool for simplifying data processing tasks:

- Reusable Data Templates: Define logic once and reuse it across multiple applications or environments.
- Streamlined Workflows: Automate repetitive data operations with minimal code.
- Scalability: Adapt templates to work seamlessly across client and server environments.

> Turn data into programs and run them anywhere â€” whether in the browser, on the server, or across multiple environments.
